  - Currently I lead a team building on-device AI infrastructure powering Gemini Nano models on Android. Prior to this, I lived in the SF Bay Area, where I worked on virtual networking infrastructure at Google Cloud.

  - When I'm not building, I usually hit the gym or spend time behind the decks DJing.
  - Feel free to reach out via my socials if you're interested in AI, entrepreneurship, and DJing, or simply want to have a chat.
